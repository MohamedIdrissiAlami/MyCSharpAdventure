# **MyCSharpAdventure**

A personal repository for my C#/.NET journey, following the 14th course of the roadmap from my teacher. This course comes after I spent significant time learning C++ and building a solid foundation of programming fundamentals over 13 previous courses.

---

## **Description**:

This repository contains my personal C#/.NET exercises and small projects. These projects are part of my journey to master C# and the .NET framework, focusing on various aspects such as object-oriented programming (OOP), Windows Forms (WinForms), and more. The projects here will be small and evolving as I work through different concepts, gradually advancing toward more complex applications.

---

## **Repository Contents**:

This repository is organized into different folders where each project is placed according to its focus. The projects will be simple at first, but as my learning progresses, I will introduce more challenging and structured applications.

### **Projects Overview**:

- **Basic C# Exercises**: Contains simple exercises that help me build the foundational knowledge of C#.
- **WinForms Projects**: As I progress, I will work on small Windows Forms (WinForms) applications that will help me better understand GUI programming in C#.
- **OOP Libraries**: Small reusable libraries that I will build to solve common tasks, just like I did in my C++ journey.
- **Real-World C# Projects**: As I gain more experience, I will upload more comprehensive applications that show how to apply the concepts I learn in real-world scenarios.

## **Mentorship by Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud**:

I am extremely fortunate to be studying under the guidance of **Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud**, a programming and project management expert. His unique approach to teaching has had a profound impact on my understanding of programming. He emphasizes practical, real-world applications over theoretical knowledge, helping students build clean, structured, and modular code.

Dr. Abu-Hadhoud‚Äôs mentorship has shaped my C# journey by providing a roadmap that not only covers language syntax but also focuses on problem-solving and application development. His teaching methodology has inspired me to approach learning with the mindset of creating meaningful, modular solutions.
